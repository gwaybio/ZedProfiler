# Texture

## Description

Texture features quantify spatial patterns and local intensity variations within segmented objects. these features are computed from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM).

## Calculation method

Texture features are derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), which captures the frequency of intensity pair relationships at specified offsets.

### Parameters

- **Gray levels**: 256 (quantization of intensity values)
- **Offset**: 1 voxel (distance for co-occurrence pairs)

These parameters can be adjusted to capture texture patterns at different scales.

**Note:** 255 is used but can be replaced with ng where: ng represents the number of gray levels (256 in this implementation).
