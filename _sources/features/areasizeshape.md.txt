## Calculation method

These features use 3D mesh reconstruction and voxel analysis:

1. **Mesh generation**: create 3D surface mesh from voxel boundaries
1. **Volume calculation**: sum voxels within segmented region
1. **Surface analysis**: compute surface area from mesh triangulation
1. **Spatial statistics**: calculate centroid and bounding box properties

## Applications

Volume.size.shape features are useful for:

- Quantifying cell and organoid growth
- Detecting morphological abnormalities
- Comparing size distributions across conditions
- Identifying fusion or fragmentation events
